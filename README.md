# ESP32 Gas Sensor Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 microcontroller to interface with a gas sensor for detecting gas concentration levels. Gas sensors are crucial in environments where monitoring gas presence is essential for safety and environmental monitoring.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Gas Sensor (Analog output type)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Block diagram


## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Gas Sensor to ESP32:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the gas sensor to analog pin 34 (or any available analog pin) on the ESP32.
   - Ensure a stable power supply and common ground (GND) connection between the ESP32 and the gas sensor.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 115200 using `Serial.begin()`.
   - Configure the gas sensor pin as an input using `pinMode()`.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the analog voltage from the gas sensor using `analogRead()`.
     - Map the analog value to a gas concentration value using the `map()` function and a calibration factor.
     - Print the calculated gas concentration to the Serial Monitor in parts per million (ppm).
     - Check if the gas concentration exceeds a predefined threshold (`gasThreshold`) to detect gas presence.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Calibration Factor:** Adjust the `calibrationFactor` based on your specific gas sensor's characteristics and the desired unit of measurement.
   - **Threshold Setting:** Define an appropriate `gasThreshold` value to trigger gas detection alerts.
   - **Sensor Selection:** Choose a gas sensor suitable for the type of gas you intend to detect and its concentration range.

## Applications
- **Safety Monitoring:** Detect gas leaks or hazardous gas concentrations in industrial and residential environments.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Measure air quality by monitoring specific gases.
- **Automated Systems:** Integrate with IoT systems for real-time monitoring and alerts.

## Notes
- **Gas Sensor Output:** Analog sensors provide a voltage output proportional to the gas concentration.
- **Threshold Alert:** Implement actions based on the detected gas concentration exceeding the threshold.
